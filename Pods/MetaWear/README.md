### Overview

[MetaWear](https://mbientlab.com) is a complete development and production platform for wearable and connected device applications.

MetaWear features a number of sensors and peripherals all easily controllable over Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy using this SDK, no firmware or hardware experience needed!

The MetaWear hardware comes pre-loaded with a wirelessly upgradeable firmware, so it keeps getting more powerful over time.

### Requirements
- [MetaWear board](https://mbientlab.com/store/)
- [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/), you can now get started for free!  Once you are ready to submit an App to the App Store, you need a paid [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).
- Device running iOS 8.0 or later with Bluetooth 4.0

> REQUIREMENT NOTES  
The iOS simulator doesnâ€™t support Bluetooth 4.0, so test apps must be run on a real iOS device which requires a developer account.  Bluetooth 4.0 available on iPhone 4S+, iPad 3rd generation+, or iPod Touch 5th generation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

MetaWear is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "MetaWear"
```
For first time CocoaPods users we have a detailed [video guide](https://youtu.be/VTb_EDv5j7A).

### Simple API Test

Here is a walkthrough to showcase a very basic connect and toggle LED operation.

First, import the framework header files like this:
```obj-c
#import <MetaWear/MetaWear.h>
```

Then add the following code wherever appropriate to make the LED flash green:
```obj-c
[[MBLMetaWearManager sharedManager] startScanForMetaWearsWithHandler:^(NSArray *array) {
    // Hooray! We found a MetaWear board, so stop scanning for more
    [[MBLMetaWearManager sharedManager] stopScanForMetaWears];
    // Connect to the board we found
    MBLMetaWear *device = [array firstObject];
    [[device connectAsync] success:^(MBLMetaWear * _Nonnull result) {
        // Hooray! We connected to a MetaWear board, so flash its LED!
        [result.led flashLEDColorAsync:[UIColor greenColor] withIntensity:0.5];
    }];
}];
```
Now run the app! 

*BLUETOOTH IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THE SIMULATOR* but we do include a simulated MetaWear for use with basic testing, however, it does not have all the features of a real MetaWear.

### Sample iOS App

We have a sample iOS App on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metawear/id920878581) and the source can be found on our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/mbientlab/Metawear-SampleiOSApp).

The sample iOS App demonstrates the base functionality of the various MetaWear modules and serves as a good starting point for developers.
